### 1. Acceptance of Terms

By setting up, running, or using the TebexSync Bot (the "Bot"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and the terms of the **GNU Affero General Public License Version 3.0 (AGPL V3.0)**, under which this software is licensed.

### 3. Disclaimer of Affiliation

**The TebexSync Bot is a third-party, independently developed integration.**

* The project and its Maintainers are **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Tebex, Discord, or any other platform** the Bot interacts with (e.g., FiveM/Cfx.re).

### 4. Self-Hosted and User Responsibility

The Bot is designed to be **self-hosted**, meaning you are fully responsible for its deployment, operation, and maintenance.

* **Host Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for securing your hosting environment, protecting sensitive credentials (such as API keys and connection cookies), and ensuring the Bot's configuration is correct.
* **Voluntary Use:** Your decision to use this Bot is entirely voluntary. The Bot's maintainers, contributors, and developers (collectively, the "Maintainers") offer the software *as-is*, without warranty of any kind.
* **Limitation of Liability:** You agree that the Maintainers are **not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages** that may arise from the use or inability to use the Bot, including but not limited to data loss, unauthorized access, synchronization errors, or any operational failures. **Using this bot is your choice, and in no way is it the Maintainers' responsibility if anything goes wrong.**

### 5. User Data and Privacy

The Bot is self-hosted and does not transmit data to the Maintainers.

* **Data Handling:** The Bot processes data from Tebex and Discord using credentials you provide. You are responsible for ensuring your data handling practices comply with all applicable privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) concerning your users' purchase and account data.

### 6. Termination

The Maintainers reserve the right to cease future development or maintenance of the Bot at any time. As the software is licensed under AGPL V3.0, you are free to continue using and modifying your self-hosted version subject to the license terms.

### 7. Changes to Terms

These Terms may be updated periodically. It is your responsibility to review the most current version of these Terms, available in the documentation or repository, when updating your Bot installation.
